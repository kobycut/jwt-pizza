# Test driven development (TDD)

üîë **Key points**

- Test driven development (TDD) accelerates development and enables refactoring.
- Master TDD through practice.

---

Test driven development ([TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)) was popularized in the 1990s as part of the [extreme programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) wave. The idea is that you begin writing software by creating tests that represent the consumer of your software. You then use the tests to drive the development of your code. When the tests pass you know that your code is complete.

TDD has been proven to add about 15% to your initial development time, but it results in better abstractions and accurate domain models, provides documentation and examples for your code, results in less bugs, makes your code more maintainable, and prevents against the introduction of future bugs.

TDD enhances the application development process by including the development of the tests while you write the application code. This helps enhance your development, by focusing first on what the code is supposed to do instead of focusing on how you are going to do it. You also know that when all the tests pass you are done with the implementation. Usually TDD works best when you develop the code and the tests at the same time. This turns the creation of the application into a _conversation_ between the implementation and the testing. You stub out parts of the implementation, write parts of the test, code part of the implementation, validate the tests pass, and repeat. This helps you think about how the code is going to be used, assures you that the implementation provides the desired result, and keeps you from breaking code that was previously working.

Today, TDD is a common industry practice that you will be expected to use on a daily basis. However, it takes effort to learn how to write tests that are effective and efficient. Making this a standard part of your development process will give you a significant advantage as you progress in your professional career.

We will demonstrate the use of TDD by implementing Fibonacci.

## Writing tests first

We start by creating a stub version of the function that simply returns zero and place it in a file named `fibonacci.js`.

```js
function fibonacci(pos) {
  return 0;
}

module.exports = fibonacci;
```

Next we install Jest and modify the package.json to tell NPM to use Jest. We install Jest using the `-D` parameter to specify that this is only used during development.

```sh
npm install -D jest
```

We also modify the `scripts` section of the `package.json` file to specify that we want to use Jest when we run tests.

**package.json**

```json
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  },
```

## Running our first tests

Now we can write a test. We will name the test file `fibonacci.test.js` so that we can easily associate the test with the implementation found in `fibonacci.js`.

Our first test will make sure that the base case for calculating the Fibonacci value at position zero works correctly.

```js
const fibonacci = require('./fibonacci.js');

test('fibonacci zero', () => {
  expect(fibonacci(0)).toBe(0);
});
```

We then run our tests using the `npm test` command. This uses the script named `test` that we created in our `package.json` file.

```sh
‚ûú npm test

PASS ./fibonacci.test.js
  ‚úì fibonacci position 0 (1 ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests: 1 passed, 1 total
```

Strangely our test passes, but that is only because we threw in a default value of zero for our stub implementation and that is the correct response for the Fibonacci position zero. This is a good reminder that you shouldn't assume the code is correct just because a test passes. Usually you want to see your test fail first and then correct the code to make it pass. That way you know it isn't a bug in the test that is hiding a bug in your code.

We will leave that test there to serve as a base case and to make sure we don't break anything as we implement the actual code.

Let's add another test that covers another basic case so that we can see a failure.

```js
test('fibonacci position 1', () => {
  expect(fibonacci(1)).toBe(1);
});
```

```sh
‚ûú npm test

 FAIL  ./fibonacci.test.js
  ‚úì fibonacci position 0 (1 ms)
  ‚úï fibonacci position 1 (1 ms)

  ‚óè fibonacci position 1

    expect(received).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality

    Expected: 1
    Received: 0

       6 |
       7 | test('fibonacci position 1', () => {
    >  8 |   expect(fibonacci(1)).toBe(1);
         |                        ^
       9 | });
      10 |

      at Object.toBe (fibonacci.test.js:8:24)

Test Suites: 1 failed, 1 total
Tests:       1 failed, 1 passed, 2 total
```

## Covering the basic functionality

Now that we are confident that the tests are working correctly, let's create another test that covers multiple calls to our Fibonacci implementation. By running through a list of positions, we will save ourselves from writing a single test for each position. This could be considered as violating the **Only test one thing** principle, but the clarity and simplicity that it provides seems to justify the exception.

```js
test('fibonacci sequence', () => {
  const pos = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
  const expected = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34];
  for (let i = 0; i < pos.length; i++) {
    expect(fibonacci(pos[i])).toBe(expected[i]);
  }
});
```

Now we are ready to drive the implementation of our code with our tests. Let's start with a simple recursive implementation.

```js
function fibonacci(pos) {
  if (pos === 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  if (pos === 1) {
    return 1;
  }
  return fibonacci(pos - 1) + fibonacci(pos - 2);
}
```

When we run our tests we see that they are all passing now.

```sh
‚ûú npm test

 PASS  ./fibonacci.test.js
  ‚úì fibonacci position 0 (1 ms)
  ‚úì fibonacci position 1
  ‚úì fibonacci sequence (2 ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       3 passed, 3 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        0.184 s
Ran all test suites.
```

## Boundary cases and bug discovery

That looks great. Now let's add a boundary test case where we provide a negative number. Since Fibonacci doesn't define what to do with a negative position, we will assume it should be zero.

```js
test('fibonacci negative', () => {
  expect(fibonacci(-1)).toBe(0);
});
```

This fails with a stack size exceeded error.

```sh
‚ûú  npm test

 FAIL  ./fibonacci.test.js
  ‚úì fibonacci position 0 (1 ms)
  ‚úì fibonacci position 1 (2 ms)
  ‚úì fibonacci sequence (1 ms)
  ‚úï fibonacci negative (1 ms)

  ‚óè fibonacci negative

    RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
```

A review of our code show that providing a negative number will just keep going negative infinitely. We fix this by modifying the first condition to also handle negative numbers. Now all the tests pass.

```js
function fibonacci(pos) {
  if (pos <= 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  if (pos === 1) {
    return 1;
  }
  return fibonacci(pos - 1) + fibonacci(pos - 2);
}
```

Let's add one more boundary test that represents a large Fibonacci position.

```js
test('fibonacci position large', () => {
  expect(fibonacci(100)).toBe(354224848179261915075);
});
```

When we run this test, it seems to block and never return. That is because a recursive implementation is O(2^n) which is 1.2676506002√ó10¬≥‚Å∞ calculations for the 100th position. To solve this we need to rewrite the function using an iterative approach.

```js
function fibonacci(pos) {
  if (pos <= 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  if (pos === 1) {
    return 1;
  }
  let prev = 0;
  let curr = 1;
  for (let i = 2; i <= pos; i++) {
    const next = prev + curr;
    prev = curr;
    curr = next;
  }
  return curr;
}
```

This implementation passes all the tests except for the `position large` test. Here we hit a problem with the JavaScript numeric type is not large enough to represent the desired value.

```sh
 FAIL  ./fibonacci.test.js
  ‚úï fibonacci position large (1 ms)
  ‚óè fibonacci position large

    expect(received).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality

    Expected: 354224848179261900000
    Received: 354224848179262000000
```

To solve this we need to convert both our tests and our code to use the BigInt numeric type. That makes our code look like the following.

**fibonacci.js**

```sh
function fibonacci(pos) {
  if (pos <= 0) {
    return 0n;
  }
  if (pos === 1) {
    return 1n;
  }
  let prev = 0n;
  let curr = 1n;
  for (let i = 2; i <= pos; i++) {
    const next = prev + curr;
    prev = curr;
    curr = next;
  }
  return curr;
}

module.exports = fibonacci;
```

**fibonacci.test.js**

```js
const fibonacci = require('./fibonacci');

test('fibonacci position 0', () => {
  expect(fibonacci(0)).toBe(0n);
});

test('fibonacci position 1', () => {
  expect(fibonacci(1)).toBe(1n);
});

test('fibonacci sequence', () => {
  const pos = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
  const expected = [1n, 2n, 3n, 5n, 8n, 13n, 21n, 34n];
  for (let i = 0; i < pos.length; i++) {
    expect(fibonacci(pos[i])).toBe(expected[i]);
  }
});

test('fibonacci negative', () => {
  expect(fibonacci(-1)).toBe(0n);
});

test('fibonacci position large', () => {
  const x = fibonacci(100);
  console.log(x);
  const t = x === 354224848179261915075n;
  expect(t).toBe(true);
});
```

Now the tests all pass.

## Refactoring and regression testing

As a final step we can refactor the implementation to make it more concise and then run the tests again to make sure we didn't break anything with our new representation.

```js
function fibonacci(pos) {
  let [prev, curr] = [0n, 1n];
  for (let i = 2; i <= pos; i++) {
    [prev, curr] = [curr, prev + curr];
  }
  return pos <= 0 ? prev : curr;
}
```

## Final thoughts

Hopefully you have seen how TDD allows you to discover problems you would not have otherwise found, speed up your development, and generate confidence that your code still works when you make future changes.

Whenever a test passes, it is also a good place to commit your changes to your version repository since you know you are in a stable state.
