# Service testing

ðŸ”‘ **Key points**

- Testing distributed services requires specialized techniques.
- Gain experience by writing service tests.

---

We can now apply what we have learned about unit testing by creating a simple HTTP service and driving our testing of the service with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and a service testing helper package called [SuperTest](https://www.testim.io/blog/supertest-how-to-test-apis-like-a-pro/).

The example HTTP service is a simple Express-based service called `City`, that provides the following endpoints.

- **Login**: Sets an authorization token
- **List cities**: Returns a list of city names and their populations
- **Add city**: Authenticates the authorization token and inserts a new city with its population

The following are the steps needed to take to create the City service and set it up for testing.

### Installing the necessary packages

First create an NPM based project and install the packages need to create an HTTP service.

```sh
npm init -y
npm install express
```

### Configuring the project

Then modify `package.json` so that it serves up the endpoints over HTTP by adding a `start` script, and runs Jest for testing by adding a `test` script.

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js",
  "test": "jest"
},
```

Create a `.gitignore` file so that we don't accidentally commit the `node_modules` or `coverage` files that will be generated as we use the project.

```txt
node_modules
coverage
```

### Providing the service endpoints

Next, create a file named `service.js` that initializes Express and defines all the endpoints. Note that it does not start the service listening on an HTTP port. It only exports the service from the module. We will put the service, represented by the `app` variable, to work in the next step.

**service.js**

```js
const express = require('express');

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

const cities = [{ name: 'Provo', population: 116618 }];
const authToken = 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6Ikp9';

app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Success', authorization: authToken });
});

app.get('/cities', (req, res) => {
  res.json(cities);
});

app.post('/cities', (req, res) => {
  const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1] ?? '';
  if (token !== authToken) {
    res.status(401).json({ message: 'Unauthorized' });
  } else {
    cities.push(req.body);
    res.json(cities);
  }
});

module.exports = app;
```

### Calling the service endpoints

We will call the service endpoints from both HTTP requests and from our automated tests.

![Endpoint requests](endpointRequests.png)

The hosting of our endpoints over HTTP is accomplished by listening on a network port with the function `app.listen(port)` as defined in a file that we create named `index.js`.

**index.js**

```js
const app = require('./service.js');

const port = process.argv[2] || 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Service started on port ${port}`);
});
```

The driving of the endpoints from our tests is accomplished by making endpoint requests through SuperTest by calling the function `request(app)` as defined in a file named `service.test.js` that we will create later.

### Smoke test

We want to make sure our service is working as expected, and so we do a quick manual smoke test to demonstrate that the service works from the command console. First start up the service.

```sh
âžœ node index.js

Service started on port 3000
```

Then execute each of the endpoints using Curl.

```sh
âžœ  curl -X POST localhost:3000/login
{"message":"Success","authorization":"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6Ikp9"}

âžœ  curl localhost:3000/cities
[{"name":"Provo","population":116618}]

âžœ  curl -X POST localhost:3000/cities -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6Ikp9' -d '{ "name":"Lehi", "population": 33435}'
[{"name":"Provo","population":116618},{"name":"Lehi","population":33435}]
```

## Add Jest and Supertest

We are now ready to set up Jest and create some automated tests. Get started by installing both Jest and SuperTest. SuperTest provides the ability to easily make endpoint requests without having to actually making HTTP network requests.

```sh
npm install -D jest supertest
```

The `-D` flag tells NPM to install these packages as a development dependency that will not be included in a production release. Here are the changes that occur in `package.json`.

```json
  "devDependencies": {
    "jest": "^29.7.0",
    "supertest": "^7.0.0"
  }
```

## Setup service for testing

Now we can create our first test by creating a file named `service.test.js`.

**service.test.js**

```js
const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('./service');

test('hello world', () => {
  expect(true).toBe(true);
});
```

This contains a single test that just demonstrates that all the parts for creating real tests are in place.

## Configuring for coverage

We want to see how much of our service code is covered by our test. We do this by adding the Jest config `jest.config.json` file and setting `collectCoverage` to true.

```json
{
  "collectCoverage": true
}
```

## Run the tests

We can now finally run our initial test and see what the coverage is. Open up a command console and execute `npm test`

```sh
âžœ  npm test

 PASS  ./service.test.js
  âœ“ hello world (1 ms)

------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|-------------------
File        | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines | Uncovered Line #s
------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|-------------------
All files   |   56.25 |        0 |       0 |   56.25 |
 service.js |   56.25 |        0 |       0 |   56.25 | 10,14,18-23
------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|-------------------
Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       1 passed, 1 total
```

This shows that our `hello world` test passed, and we have **56.25%** coverage without even writing a meaningful test. This happened because we imported `service.js` in our test file. That caused all the initialization code to execute even though no endpoints were called.

## Testing the endpoints

Let's delete the `hello world` test and write some tests that actually hit the endpoints.

### Get cities

First we will test the `[GET] /cities` endpoint.

```js
test('get cities', async () => {
  const getCitiesRes = await request(app).get('/cities');
  expect(getCitiesRes.status).toBe(200);
  expect(getCitiesRes.headers['content-type']).toMatch('application/json; charset=utf-8');
  expect(getCitiesRes.body).toMatchObject([{ name: 'Provo', population: 116618 }]);
});
```

This calls the `[GET] /cities` endpoint using the SuperTest `request(app)` function. The result of the asynchronous call is an object that has all the information about the response. This includes the status, headers, and body. We can then use the Jest expectation object and matchers to validate the response.

When we run the test, everything is green, and we jump to **62.5%** coverage.

```sh
âžœ  npm test

 PASS  ./service.test.js
  âœ“ get cities (11 ms)

------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|-------------------
File        | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines | Uncovered Line #s
------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|-------------------
All files   |    62.5 |        0 |   33.33 |    62.5 |
 service.js |    62.5 |        0 |   33.33 |    62.5 | 10,18-23
------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|-------------------
Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       1 passed, 1 total
```

### Login

Next on our list is to test the `[POST] /login` endpoint. We need to do this now because it is necessary to login before we can call our last endpoint.

This test is a little more complex because we have to deal with the authorization token. However, other than the authorization header and the change from a `get` request to a `post` request, it is pretty similar to the previous test.

```js
test('login', async () => {
  const loginRes = await request(app).post('/login');
  expect(loginRes.status).toBe(200);
  expect(loginRes.headers['content-type']).toMatch('application/json; charset=utf-8');
  expect(loginRes.body.message).toMatch('Success');
  expect(loginRes.body.authorization).toMatch(/^[a-zA-Z0-9]*$/);
});
```

The authorization token is returned in the body of the response. Even though our simple service code always returns the same authorization token, we want to make our test more general than that, so we use a regular expression match to validate that the authorization token matches the pattern we expect.

When we run the tests again we see that we are up to **68.75%**. So close that I can taste it. Just one more endpoint to test.

### Add city

The `[POST] /cities` endpoint requires that we have previously logged in, so we need to combine this test with the action of logging in. We don't want to repeat the code for logging in for every endpoint that requires authorization, so we are going to decompose the problem and reuse the login functionality in order to create our last test.

Here is what the resulting tests look like.

```js
test('get cities', async () => {
  const getCitiesRes = await request(app).get('/cities');
  expect(getCitiesRes.status).toBe(200);
  expect(getCitiesRes.headers['content-type']).toMatch('application/json; charset=utf-8');
  expect(getCitiesRes.body).toMatchObject([{ name: 'Provo', population: 116618 }]);
});

test('login', login);

async function login() {
  const loginRes = await request(app).post('/login');

  expect(loginRes.status).toBe(200);
  expect(loginRes.headers['content-type']).toMatch('application/json; charset=utf-8');
  expect(loginRes.body.message).toMatch('Success');
  expect(loginRes.body.authorization).toMatch(/^[a-zA-Z0-9]*$/);

  return loginRes.body.authorization;
}

test('add cities', async () => {
  const authToken = await login();

  const city = { name: 'Orem', population: 89932 };
  const addCitiesRes = await request(app).post('/cities').set('Authorization', `Bearer ${authToken}`).send(city);

  expect(addCitiesRes.status).toBe(200);
  expect(addCitiesRes.headers['content-type']).toMatch('application/json; charset=utf-8');
  expect(addCitiesRes.body).toMatchObject([
    { name: 'Provo', population: 116618 },
    { name: 'Orem', population: 89932 },
  ]);
});
```

The `add cities` test gets the authorization token from the login request and passes it as a header with the post request to add a new city. The rest is just assertions that we got back a list containing both the old and new cities.

## Diagnosing missing coverage

With the above tests implemented we are now up to **93.75%** coverage. Where is the remaining 6.25%? If we turn on coverage display using the VS Code Jest extension, we can visually see that the remaining code is the failure case where an invalid or missing token is provided when calling to get the cities.

![Missing coverage](missingCoverage.png)

We can fix that by writing a test that doesn't provide the authorization token and expects to get back a 401 HTTP status code.

```js
test('add cities no auth', async () => {
  const city = { name: 'Orem', population: 89932 };
  const addCitiesRes = await request(app).post('/cities').send(city);
  expect(addCitiesRes.status).toBe(401);
});
```

Now we have ðŸ’¯ coverage with 46 lines of testing code used to assure the quality of 30 lines of service code. That is a _1:.65_ ratio. Not a horrible amount of work, and we will sleep better tonight knowing that we can extend or refactor this code with confidence that we didn't break anything.

## â˜‘ Exercise

Create a node.js project named serviceTestingExample. Reproduce the steps given above in order to solidify your understanding of the concepts.

Once you are done, you should have 100% coverage. It should look similar to the image shown below.
